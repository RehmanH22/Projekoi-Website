                Caring for your roses is easy- you don't need to care for them!

                But, there are things to keep in mind to help them last as long as possible:
                <br><br>
                1. Keep them out of direct sunlight. This means avoid placing them outside.
                Indirect sunlight from curtained windows are fine.
                <br><br>
                2. Never spray water or fragrances on them. Liquids and fragrances will impact the preservatives and rapidly degrade the roses.
                <br><br>
                3. Only dust off debris with a feather duster when needed, and do so extremely gently.
                <br><br>
                4. Avoid touching the actual roses with your hands, and never attempt to remove the roses from the boxes.
                <br><br>
                Keep touching to a minimum. These roses are meant for your eyes only.

                Each box of roses lasts about 3-5 years if cared for properly according to the instructions above, and can even last longer under the right conditions!
                <br><br>
                Different environmental factors such as humidity in the area you live in can also impact the lifespan of your roses.
                <br><br>
                Each rose is unique and reacts differently to environmental conditions.
                <br><br>
                but you can make your roses last as long as possible by following the simple instructions above.
